## R1 owned-TLS handshake readiness hardening (2026-10-16; exact-SHA CI pending)

**Starting reconciled shared \`main\`:** \`32f46276add9b387e71962376da4329537eff2d8\`.

The common real-loopback helper used by the owned TLS application, CredSSP and
R3 transport regressions still completed its initial OpenSSL handshake with a
16,384-iteration scheduler-\`yield()\` loop. The HYBRID negotiation regression
duplicated the same pattern with a one-millisecond sleep. These waits occurred
before the later bounded application-I/O assertions, so a scheduler delay could
masquerade as handshake progress even though R1 already owns an exact bounded
socket-readiness dispatcher.

The test fixture now uses one shared
\`finishOwnedApplicationTlsHandshake()\` helper. The client performs exactly one
\`SSL_do_handshake\` step per iteration and accepts only WANT_READ/WANT_WRITE;
the server advances only through
\`OwnedPreauthTcpConnection::pollSocketOnce\` with
\`kMaximumTcpPollWait\` under one five-second monotonic deadline. Completion
requires the client init state, the same R1-owned established SSL and R1's Read
interest. The HYBRID provenance regression and
\`establishOwnedApplicationTlsForRequest\` both use this path.

This is test-harness reliability only. No production socket/BIO/SSL source,
native descriptor accessor, TLS retry policy, 18 KiB application-I/O ceiling,
authorization result, licensing lifecycle or listener surface changes. Existing
behavior CTests remain authoritative; the shared helper is exercised by the
owned application-I/O, HYBRID, CredSSP and R3 licensing transport cases already
selected by the bounded R9 R1/R3 sanitizer group.

The newly landed R10 \`RuntimeLicensingAuthority\` does not unblock live R1
grant publication: production supports only \`NoVerifiedIssuer\`; positive
providers remain test-only, and R2 still does not invoke PAM or create final
credential/native admission. R1 therefore does not add a detached grant writer
or fabricate positive authorization.

Canonical owner-local \`~/rdp-server/build/\` configure/build/full CTest is
**NOT RUN** in this connector environment; no alternate persistent build root
or branch is created. Exact publication-SHA Linux/GCC, macOS/AppleClang,
Windows/MSVC Debug/Release, R9 sanitizer, documentation-policy and SDK/package
evidence are **PENDING**.

**Next R1:** keep the live-publication dependency gate. A fail-closed R10
authority owner is not a CAL issuer. Wait for a genuine supported issuer
adapter plus positive R2 admission/reauthorization before integrating the R3
grant gate with the sole R1 TLS writer, unless a concrete Share-activation
transport mismatch appears first.

## R7 current-display cursor publication authoring receipt (2026-10-16)

**Starting shared main:** `3069b2f1e07198d0e060c1619924f9654ffb8826`.  
**Publication parent after shared-main reconciliation:** `c800ef3cacc59d3cc4bc442f5d3a1c88c01ac555`.  
Exact publication-SHA hosted validation: **PENDING**.

The R7 cursor consumer now has an explicit current-geometry contract:
`MacCursorSnapshot::validFor` / `pixelsFor` synchronously revalidate the
stored geometry generation, topology revision, GUI-session revision and visible
display identity against the caller-owned `NativeDisplayGeometryRefresh`.
No geometry owner is retained and no native cursor sampler, TCC prompt,
capture/input path, R2/R3 authority or R4 pointer publication is exposed.

New production-backed CTests are
`macos.cursor-topology-publication-revocation` and
`macos.cursor-geometry-generation-publication-denials`; the existing
`macos.cursor-session-watch-revocation` remains intact and now traverses the
same checked consumer path. The road-local GCC ASan/UBSan job
registry-preflights and runs all three cursor cases. Synthetic BGRA/geometry
evidence is only a lifetime/freshness regression gate, not macOS 27 native
desktop or Microsoft-client acceptance.
