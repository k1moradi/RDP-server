# CODEX_VALIDATION.md — validation ledger and agent contract

Read **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** on every prompt together with
[VISION.md](VISION.md), the living TODO in
[docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and the mandatory
[coding](coding_standards.md), [testing](testing_standards.md),
[compilation](compile.md) and [benchmark](benchmark.md) standards.

The detailed acceptance contracts live in `docs/testing_standards.md`.
This file records the evidence, not an alternative test policy.

## Local validation (one reused build root)

```sh
cmake -S "$HOME/rdp-server" -B "$HOME/rdp-server/build" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build "$HOME/rdp-server/build" --config Debug --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir "$HOME/rdp-server/build" -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

No second local build folder. GitHub Actions each run from one
ephemeral checkout-local `build/`. Tests are C++23, behavior-named,
reusable and automated; run focused and whole CTest plus cross-platform
CI and documentation-policy gate. Do not mask failures.

## Historical verified snapshot

- Original migrated `main` at
  `77c94c75b467f25c3911912ff4a24690894768c8`:
  [GitHub Actions run 38516048776](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38516048776)
  was successful with ten original portable protocol tests.
- The semantic test registry, single build-root guard and documentation
  co-change check passed at
  `3196a764ffbe24482ad131ad6949f1c2c23d44d9` in
  [GitHub Actions run 38535115706](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38535115706):
  Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy jobs.
  CMake now registers ten semantic native protocol tests plus one
  project-policy test. These are **offline library tests**, not
  end-to-end desktop or OS admission acceptance.
- Full former project source and unique implementation progress import remains incomplete; historical Git ancestry is not the goal.
  A green protocol static library is **not** a functional desktop server.

## Per-task evidence

Record exact SHA and modified paths, vision/TODO objective, Microsoft
protocol boundary, exact commands/environment, PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT RUN
results, first failing transition, safety/ownership constraints,
updated documentation and next milestone. Never turn synthetic
authentication fixtures into a claim of real OS session admission.

## Verified strict local-path policy CI (2026-10-14)

The stricter home-checkout and single-build-root guard in
`e1843b07c8772588f29e45a9b8e328e51c59e2ff` passed all four
[Actions run 38535723210](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38535723210)
jobs: Ubuntu/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy.
CMake enforces the checkout-local `build/` and requires ordinary
non-CI checkouts at `~/rdp-server`; GitHub-hosted CI has a documented
workspace exception. Direct verification on the owner's local computer
remains NOT RUN. No live client or authenticated desktop acceptance is
implied by these green jobs.

## New transport stream intake milestone (pending CI)

This commit adds `PreauthConnectionStream` on top of the existing
X.224 parser and preauthentication session, with bounded first-packet
reassembly and exact consumed-byte accounting. The reused
`transport.preauth-session` CTest was extended with fragment,
coalescing, malformed-length, TLS-dispatch and terminal-close negatives.
**PASS:** [exact-head GitHub Actions run 38536987879](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38536987879),
commit `988938a90f8adbae4e07714ac636af3eb0640011`, passed
Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy CTests.
This verifies the existing compiled preauth protocol suite and the
new bounded-fragment intake negative cases. The first **unimplemented**
boundary is a network listener coupled to a real TLS provider and
authenticated post-negotiation session. Real TLS/credential validation,
desktop admission and external RDP clients remain **NOT RUN**;
no production activation.

## X.224 write-completion ordering (pending exact-head CI)

In the existing `PreauthConnectionStream`, the connection reply
completion gate now precedes the preauthentication TLS transition.
Tests were added to the existing `transport.preauth-session` CTest:
premature TLS, write failure, duplicate reply completion, early
completion report and accepted one-shot completion. **PASS:** [Actions run 38537586258](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38537586258)
completed successfully for exact commit
`18262c0e4bf9bc4ecec4c2d56b069d4fc723b1f1`, with
Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy jobs
green. This is a tested **offline preauthentication ordering rule**,
not a listening socket, real TLS handshake, CredSSP, user authentication
or OS session access; those categories remain NOT RUN.

## Verified bounded decrypted MCS/GCC intake (2026-10-14)

New reusable `PreauthConnectionStream::consumeDecryptedMcsConnectInitial`
uses one fixed buffer for the initial plaintext and the subsequent
decrypted MCS/GCC envelope. Existing `transport.preauth-session`
gains every-split, truncation, coalesced-packet, invalid header,
malformed BER, wrong-state and replay tests against production code.
**PASS:** [Actions run 38541509607](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38541509607) at `49c6006d47476184f7448028cd332e377ec9bd0b` completed Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC CMake builds and full CTests, plus documentation-policy. **NOT RUN:** owner's local `~/rdp-server/build/`, host networking, real TLS certificates, CredSSP/NLA, external RDP clients and OS admission. **Next:** authenticated TLS provider and MCS response lifecycle.

## Verified CI/CD protocol SDK automation (2026-10-14)

The unified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs Debug and Release
builds/full CTests on Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang and Windows/MSVC, followed
by one staged install per runner, a nested downstream CMake consumer
configure/compile/CTest, CPack ZIP creation and artifact SHA-256
publication. A matching `protocol-vX.Y.Z` tag reachable from
`main` publishes a GitHub **prerelease** only after all platform
and documentation-policy jobs have succeeded. The new consumer tests
that the installed `RDPServer::protocol` target is usable.

**PASS:** [GitHub Actions run 38543429777](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38543429777)
at exact commit `1aa025960288d40f476e85c5a9c5f97b06bebf20`
completed Ubuntu/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy.
For each OS the workflow configured/built/ran CTest in Debug,
reconfigured the **same** `build/` root for Release, ran Release
CTest, installed the SDK under `build/stage/`, compiled and ran the
downstream `tests/consumer` CTest under `build/consumer/`, and
successfully generated/uploaded CPack ZIP and SHA-256 manifests.
Artifacts: `protocol-package-ubuntu-latest`,
`protocol-package-macos-latest`, and
`protocol-package-windows-latest` (3 packages confirmed).

**SKIPPED / NOT RUN:** the gated GitHub release publishing job
(no `protocol-vX.Y.Z` tag was pushed), owner's local PC build,
live server/socket/service, real TLS/NLA, OS authorization, and
external RDP desktop acceptance. The next delivery gate is
a reviewed version tag to test the prerelease publish step;
the next functional gate is an authenticated native RDP server.

## Documentation relocation and CMake script-mode policy (2026-10-14)

Root docs were moved to `docs/` at commit
`e3e6a7576f530280a1095f8e15f058d7da07f52d`. All 47
internal documentation hyperlinks were rebased; root entrypoints
were preserved. **FAIL:** [Actions run 38544805819](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38544805819)
failed `project.policy` on Ubuntu during Debug CTest because
`cmake -P` did not enable CMP0057 for `if(IN_LIST)`.
Ten native protocol suites passed on Ubuntu. Changed the root-layout
policy guard to `list(FIND)` in this follow-up implementation.
**PASS:** the corrected `cmake -P` root-layout guard at
`f68d1d417424823eed7856761ff95f0ebe1eabb2` passed
[GitHub Actions run 38544988535](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38544988535)
on Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy.
Each runner passed Debug and Release full CTests, staged SDK install,
downstream CMake consumer, CPack ZIP and SHA-256 artifact upload.
`project.policy` now checks required relocated docs and permits only
five canonical root-level Markdown entrypoints.
**NOT RUN:** owner-local `~/rdp-server/build/`, real clients, RDP
network listener, OS admission and service deployment.

## OpenSSL server TLS transition evidence (pending exact-head CI)

The previous `PreauthConnectionStream::onTlsHandshake(bool)` could
proceed on a caller-supplied synthetic signal. This transport API
now requires a fully handshaken server-side OpenSSL `SSL*` with a
selected certificate, cipher, and negotiated TLS 1.2+.
The existing `transport.preauth-session` CTest performs a real
in-memory OpenSSL client/server handshake and checks wrong role,
unfinished handshake, missing pointer, send-before-TLS and replay.

**NOT RUN** until exact-head CI verifies Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang,
Windows/MSVC, documentation-policy, Debug/Release, downstream
consumer and SDK packaging. **NOT RUN:** local owner checkout,
actual TCP listener, certificate enrollment, CredSSP/NLA,
OS identity authorization and external RDP clients.

## TLS boundary Windows compatibility failure (2026-10-14)

**Initial FAIL:** commit `a25b5186398e4a5619baea2998a61596fa7b2887`
[Actions run 38551275680](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38551275680)
reported MSVC C2589/C2059 in
`src/server/transport/preauth_session.cpp` at `std::min`,
due to platform macro leakage from an OpenSSL header.
macOS and documentation-policy PASS. Corrected the public
include to `openssl/types.h`, included `ssl.h` only in
translation units using OpenSSL, and protected the two
`std::min` expressions with parenthesized function names.
**Next:** cross-platform Debug/Release full CTests, downstream
SDK consumer and ZIP packages on the corrected exact head.
