# RDP-server protocol roadmap and acceptance gates

## Target

Develop an independently maintained, secure, standards-compliant C++23 RDP
server protocol stack, portable across OSes via system adapters. Use native
RDP capabilities, not VNC, xrdp, clipboard injection helpers, or nonstandard
screen-sharing workarounds.

## Status: foundation, not release

Current code includes X.224/TPKT, selected MCS/GCC parsers, negotiation,
CredSSP/DER and CLIPRDR helpers, verified graphics algorithms and portable
testable core. It does **not** yet operate a complete authenticated RDP
server session. The library has no shipping daemon/installer.

## Delivery order

1. **Wire interoperability:** bounded TPKT/X.224, security negotiation,
   MCS/GCC, TLS, CredSSP/NLA credential and channel binding; state-machine
   fuzzing against hostile and truncated PDUs
2. **Authenticated session:** implement complete server-side MCS attach,
   channel join, licensing semantics, capability exchange, Demand Active,
   Confirm Active, share data, transport lifecycle and disconnect
3. **Virtual channels:** CLIPRDR/RDPSND/DRDYNVC channel routing,
   fragmentation/reassembly, concurrent lifecycle and error semantics
4. **Graphics:** standards-compliant desktop update path, RDPGFX and negotiated
   H.264/RemoteFX/bitmap codecs; independent frame coherence and RDP client
   acknowledgement/backpressure
5. **Platform adapters:** Linux (X11/Wayland as separately negotiated backends),
   macOS, Windows and other platforms for capture, input, cursor, session and
   identity with the same protocol-independent C++ core
6. **End-to-end clipboard:** negotiate Unicode, PNG and DIB; validate
   generation correctness and X11/OS clipboard ownership; require a trusted
   macOS screenshot paste into Firefox with a genuine non-null
   `ClipboardEvent.clipboardData.items[].getAsFile()` of type `image/png`
7. **Performance, packaging and release:** benchmark against real Windows
   App and FreeRDP clients on multiple OSes, exercise slow/fast links,
   instrument latency, and ship a standalone installable RDP server only
   once all gates pass

## Acceptance policy

- Offline CTest and static library compilation are foundation gates.
- Native protocol integration, TLS/NLA security, external clients, graphics,
  input, clipboard, session admission, OS backends and real desktop access
  are **not yet accepted**; never infer them from a green unit test.
- No new Git branches may be created by assistants/agents without an explicit
  request from the owner.
- Preserve attributions and third-party licenses for upstream-inspired code,
  but do not depend on an xrdp daemon, patched chansrv or VNC runtime.

## Living TODO — authoritative project checklist

This is the **single current TODO list**, required context on **every
prompt**. Update the *same* item when implementation, blocker or evidence
changes; don't create another milestone list. Apply [VISION](VISION.md)
and the four mandatory [coding](coding_standards.md),
[testing](testing_standards.md), [build](compile.md) and
[benchmark](benchmark.md) standards. Checkboxes require measured
acceptance evidence; no synthetic completion claims.

### P0 — Preserve work and implement a native RDP server

- [x] Independently compile/test C++23 static protocol foundation;
  historical Actions run 38516048776 succeeded at 77c94c75b467.
  This **is not** a working RDP desktop server.
- [x] Retire the obsolete legacy-source migration guide and both import
  scripts by owner request. The original project was **not fully
  imported**; only the maintained, checked-in first-party code is in
  scope for ongoing development. Additional historical source requires
  a separately authorized and reviewed integration, not an automatic
  import. This is a cleanup gate, not a functional RDP milestone.
- [ ] Implement bounded X.224/TPKT/MCS/GCC network listener and complete
  standards-compliant server connection state machine with external-client
  handshake and malformed-packet evidence.
  **Completed partial increment at `988938a90f8adbae4e07714ac636af3eb0640011`:**
  bounded incremental plaintext Connection Request intake, exact TCP
  consumed-byte accounting, correct negotiation response/terminal failure,
  all request split points and malformed-length negative tests.
  **PASS:** [Actions run 38536987879](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38536987879)
  on Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy;
  registered protocol and policy CTests passed.
  The *overall* milestone stays **open**: a real TCP listener, TLS provider,
  authenticated session, MCS response and external-client handshake
  remain **NOT RUN / unimplemented**.
  **Additional partial increment `18262c0e4bf9bc4ecec4c2d56b069d4fc723b1f1`:**
  the existing preauth owner requires exactly one completed X.224
  reply write before accepting a TLS transition. Premature TLS,
  failed/partial and repeated acknowledgments fail closed.
  **PASS:** [Actions run 38537586258](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38537586258)
  on Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy.
  The overall listener/TLS/authentication milestone is still open;
  **no real socket, TLS provider or external client was tested**.
  **Verified increment at `49c6006d47476184f7448028cd332e377ec9bd0b`:** reuses the same preauth
  buffer to reassemble exactly one decrypted RFC 1006/X.224 Data TPDU
  carrying a BER MCS Connect Initial and GCC Conference Create Request.
  The native test exercises every split/truncation point, coalesced
  next-PDU bytes, invalid TPKT length/X.224 type, BER errors and
  replay/close. This is NOT a real TLS or admitted RDP session.
  **PASS:** [Actions run 38541509607](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38541509607) on Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy. **NOT RUN:** live TLS/NLA, host listener and external client.
  **Next boundary:** real TLS provider plus authenticated session
  policy and complete MCS response handling.
  **Current partial security increment (CI pending):**
  `PreauthConnectionStream` requires a completed, server-role
  OpenSSL TLS 1.2+ session with selected certificate/cipher, instead of
  accepting a caller-supplied Boolean. The existing transport CTest
  now exercises an actual in-memory OpenSSL TLS handshake and negative
  wrong-role, pre-handshake, null, early and replay transitions.
  This does **not** implement socket TLS I/O, trusted OS session
  authorization, CredSSP/NLA or MCS Connect-Response.
  **First CI result:** macOS and documentation-policy PASS,
  Windows Compile Debug FAIL at `a25b5186398e4a5619baea2998a61596fa7b2887`
  ([Actions run 38551275680](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38551275680))
  because OpenSSL's platform includes exposed a `min` macro
  affecting the existing `std::min(...)` intake calls.
  The follow-up fixes OpenSSL header isolation and call syntax.
  **PASS:** fixed OpenSSL include/Windows macro handling at
  `edfaf2e7ea684ab5adc77bf58441ff467288f818`, verified by
  [Actions run 38551496274](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38551496274):
  Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy
  all passed Debug/Release full CTests, downstream SDK consumer
  and per-OS ZIP/checksum artifact uploads.
  **NOT RUN:** real socket TLS peer, trusted credentials/NLA,
  OS desktop admission, external RDP clients or owner's local
  build of this new commit. **Next:** integrate an authenticated
  TLS transport/session lifecycle without permitting OS admission
  before CredSSP/identity authorization.
  **Verified TLS application-record increment `a226f15827e9da48ad7a91b7cfa53528c3498802`:** the existing
  preauth stream now associates the completed OpenSSL server `SSL*`
  with the connection and uses `SSL_read_ex` to decrypt and parse
  precisely one bounded MCS/GCC TPKT. WANT_READ/WANT_WRITE do not
  close the connection; EOF, malformed data, swapped SSL handles
  and replay fail closed. The memory-BIO test drives actual encrypted
  TLS application records at every split boundary, coalesced trailing
  PDU, invalid header and early close. Neither a socket listener
  nor CredSSP/OS admission is implemented.
  **PASS:** [Actions run 38557465241](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38557465241),
  Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy; all
  Debug/Release protocol and project-policy CTests, staged SDK install,
  downstream consumer and platform ZIP/checksum uploads passed.
  **NOT RUN:** user's local build of this exact head, external client,
  TCP TLS listener, OS identity admission and desktop interaction.
  **Next:** nonblocking socket adapter and authenticated session policy,
  without equating a TLS handshake with user authentication.
- [ ] Implement TLS, CredSSP/NLA and independently verified OS session
  authorization, including security downgrade and failure tests.
- [ ] Implement licensing, capabilities/share activation, virtual-channel
  routing, graphics delivery, keyboard/pointer and correct lifecycle.

### P1 — Real client features and performance

- [ ] Unify CLIPRDR Unicode, PNG/DIB, file streaming, transfer generations
  and local OS clipboard ownership under one C++23 session authority.
  Never require FUSE or `~/thinclient_drives` by default.
- [ ] Verify macOS screenshot through RDP into Firefox produces a genuine
  synchronous PNG File, not merely successful generic X11 transfer.
- [ ] Integrate isolated Linux/X11/Wayland, Windows and macOS desktop,
  clipboard and input adapters; test real Microsoft/FreeRDP clients.
- [ ] Measure native server CPU/RAM, bandwidth, graphics and clipboard
  p50/p95/p99; only then claim performance improvements.

### P0 — Standards and repeatable automation

- [x] The canonical agent policy, four mandatory domain standards,
  behavior-named CTest suites, documentation co-change checker and
  local-home-checkout/single-build-root CMake guards passed
  [Actions run 38535723210](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38535723210)
  at `e1843b07c8772588f29e45a9b8e328e51c59e2ff`.
  Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy
  jobs all succeeded. This proves the **CI's isolated checkout
  exception** and offline protocol/policy gates only; the owner's
  persistent `~/rdp-server/build/` and real clients were NOT RUN.
- [x] Automate Debug/Release C++23 builds and full offline CTest,
  staged SDK installation, downstream package consumer verification,
  per-OS ZIP archives and SHA-256 manifests. **PASS:** commit
  `1aa025960288d40f476e85c5a9c5f97b06bebf20`,
  [Actions run 38543429777](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38543429777):
  Linux/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy;
  **three uploaded protocol SDK packages verified**.
- [ ] Exercise automatic tagged GitHub **prerelease publication**
  (`protocol-vX.Y.Z` corresponding to CMake project version, from `main`).
  Release job is configured and gated on successful matrix/maintenance
  checks, but was **SKIPPED / NOT RUN** because no release tag was
  created. Publishing an SDK is **not** installation, activation or
  authenticated end-to-end deployment of an RDP server.
- [x] Consolidate all seven non-entrypoint root Markdown documents
  under `docs/` while retaining `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `agent.md`, `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`
  at repository root. Rebase 47 links, fix attribution package
  install path and enforce the layout using the canonical policy CTest.
  **Initial FAIL:** [run 38544805819](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38544805819)
  at `e3e6a7576f530280a1095f8e15f058d7da07f52d` uncovered
  missing CMP0057 in standalone `cmake -P` policy script (10 native
  protocol tests still passed on Ubuntu).
  **PASS:** corrected `list(FIND)` at
  `f68d1d417424823eed7856761ff95f0ebe1eabb2` in
  [Actions run 38544988535](https://github.com/k1moradi/RDP-server/actions/runs/38544988535):
  Ubuntu/GCC, macOS/Clang, Windows/MSVC and documentation-policy
  passed full Debug/Release CTests, SDK installation, downstream
  consumer and package upload.
  **NOT RUN:** owner-local builds, real clients and service deployment.
- [ ] Expand reusable sanitizer, parser-fuzz, security-negative and real
  client acceptance suites as native runtime code becomes available.

Each implementation updates the relevant item with exact SHA, test
PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT RUN, first failing boundary and next smallest step.
Put detailed lessons into the appropriate domain standard, not new files.
